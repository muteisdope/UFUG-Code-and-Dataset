Decoding Urban Green Spaces: Deep Learning and Google Street View Measure Green Structures Code as well as usage data (including GSV image retrieval)

The above document is about the manuscript Decoding Urban Green Spaces: Deep Learning and Google Street View Measure Green Structures 

Code as well as usage data (including GSV image retrieval)

Only the files in the UFUG file are those used in the manuscript, 
the rest of the files are redundant at the time of upload and do not need to be downloaded for use.

For DeepLabV3+ source code, please move to the open source website of Chen et al.

The SGSS dataset will be available for download in another dedicated repository in my home page.

UFUG folder contains street crawl code with GSV street image, while csv file is the index date of street image.
